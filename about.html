                My name is Rasmus Pedersen.
                <br><br>
                I am currently studying at Zealand in KÃ¸ge, Denmark and the specific course is Multimedia Designer, or MMD for short.
                <br>
                I have a ton of experience in web development, both from designing and coding many different sites. I have designed and coded this specific site as well. I have also gained a lot of experience in other sorts of coding from previous educations. These coding languages involves Python, C# and JavaScript. So in the end, I can personally code all sorts of things, which can be seen in websites and games.
                I personally would like to put more weight on the designing part of the process, but simply said, am just better at the coding process.
