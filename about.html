                My name is Rasmus Pedersen.
                <br><br>
                I am currently studying as a multimedia designer at Zealand KÃ¸ge, Denmark. I have a ton of experience in web development, both from designing and coding many different sites, including this one.
                <br><br>
                I have also gained a lot of experience in other sorts of coding projects, such as games and calculators.
                I have an experience working with programmable languages, such as Python, C# and JavaScript, which gives me a wide range of basic knowledge to use in coding.
                <br><br>
                Personally, I want to put more weight on the design perspective but am also interested in the coding process behind the projects.
